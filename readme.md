## Modal Usage

#### ES Module

This method is a wrapper around the [Patterns Scripts dialog utility](https://github.com/CityOfNewYork/patterns-scripts/tree/main/src/dialog) which is included as a dependency of this project. The utility can be imported as an ES module and instantiated separately.

```javascript
import Modal from 'pattern-modal/src/modal';

new Modal();
```
